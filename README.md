# NoSnooping
Hinder family members or others snooping on your computer.
Made for Windows 10 and works on Windows 11 with admin.

* Logs if any unwanted user activity is present.
* Hides the console window and puts it as a backgroundsprocess.
* Immediate force shutdown if any commands are being inputed.
* Utilises a secret code which terminates the program. The code being 3 + h + F5 atm but can easily be changed in the source code with Microsoft Visual Keycodes.

Autostart:
The program manipulates the Windows registry for autostart everytime the computer reboots. But you have to run the program once, go to the task manager, then the autostart page and activate NoSnooping.exe.
Then Windows believes it is a safe program and then the autostart function works as is should.
