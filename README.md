# NoSnooping 

Basically locks your computer so no one can view your stuff.
Hinder family members or others snooping on your computer.



## It does the following:
- Runs silently in the background
- Automatically adds itself to Windows startup by manipulating the Windows regestry
- Logs general user input activity (mouse/keyboard, not exact keys) to log.txt
- Teminates and removes itself from startup with 3-key secret code
- Immediate force shutdown if any commands are being tried.



## How to Use
The program is meant for Windows 10 and Windows 11.
But the first time you run it, Windows may not like it and the autostart 
function will not work.
So, 
1. Run the program once and terminate it with the secret code (3 + h + F5).
2. Open the task manager and head to the autostart page.
3. Activate the listed program named NoSnooping.exe.
4. 
This will make Windows think you trust it and the autostart
function will work without you having to do anything.
The included metadata in the .rc and .res files does not help this case,
even though that is what they are for.



## Disclamer 
Use at own risk and don't use it for malicious purposes. Atleast don't say you got it from here.
